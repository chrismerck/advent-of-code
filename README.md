Note that I never push work on a problem on the day of release as not to interfere with leaderboards.

In 2022, I was "learning" Rust by using CoPilot to solve AoC problems. I didn't retain much.

Now in 2023, I'm working thru "Programming Rust" by Blandy et al., referring to the official docs, and only occasionally using AI assistance. The goal is to optimize the learning rate (which should optimize for long-term problem solving rate).
